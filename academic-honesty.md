# **Principles of Academic Honesty**

*Adapted from the [Columbia University Computer Science Department Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/academic/academic-honesty/)*

---

The Computer Science Department enforces the general University and school policies on academic honesty, as described in the Bulletins of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, of Columbia College, and of the School of General Studies; in the Honor Code booklet of Barnard College; and in other related publications.

Further, the Department expects conduct appropriate to Computer Science professionals. Additionally, this policy addresses those aspects of academic honesty that are especially related to the use of computers and other electronic devices.

In order to enforce the principles of fairness and proportionality while also ensuring uniform departmental standards, the Department separates disciplinary penalties from academic ones. The penalties of warning, probation, suspension, and expulsion are administered by the deans. Grading penalties are administered by its instructors.

## **General Policies**

Unless specifically authorized by the instructor, **all coursework is to be done by the student working alone**. Unless specifically authorized by the instructor, no external aids or electronic devices are allowed during exams.

An instructor may refine academic honesty as appropriate for the course. As an example, instructors may specify rules regarding the conditions under which work done by other people, or by the student previously, can be incorporated into an assignment, project, or exam. Violations will be subject to the standard academic and disciplinary penalties. If group work is permitted by an instructor, academic honesty policies continue to apply on a student-by-student basis; the full team is not necessarily held responsible for an individual's violations.

Instructors are asked to promulgate and permit student exploration of the Department's policy at the beginning of every course. They are to announce in class or by website that, by taking the course, the student is presumed to be aware of the Departmental policy, and that the text of the policy can be found on the Department's web pages. However, regardless of any question of instructor announcement or student discussion, student understanding of the policy is assumed.

The Academic Committee maintains for instructor reference a secure list of academic honesty violators, which records their academic penalties, and also, when permitted by the student's school, their disciplinary penalties. Among other penalties, students found in violation of academic honesty rules by the deans may be prohibited from serving as departmental Teaching Assistants, from receiving departmental financial support, and from being recognized with departmental awards.

## **Procedures and Penalties**

If an instructor suspects academic dishonesty, the instructor contacts the student or students involved and asks for explanations. The instructor can request a meeting with the student or students, who may be seen individually or as a group, and with or without witnesses. If the explanations appear inadequate, the instructor informs the student or students that academic dishonesty is suspected, applies the appropriate academic penalties and registers the penalties with the Academic Committee, and reports the incident to the appropriate dean or deans together with a written summary of the investigation.

### **Academic Penalties**

- **First offense:** Grade of zero on the assignment, project, or exam, or reduction of the course grade at the discretion of the instructor
- **Second and subsequent offenses:** Failure of the course
- **Severe infractions:** Instructor may immediately fail a student

Students may appeal academic penalties in writing to the Academic Committee within 10 business days, or in those cases investigated by the deans, within 10 business days of the deans' decision.

The deans may pursue a separate investigation and determine appropriate disciplinary action, which may include **suspension or expulsion**.

## **Examples of Academic Dishonesty**

‚úÖ Students solving a problem as a **group** when group work is permitted, and submitting one copy of work as group work, identifying each member of the group

‚úÖ A student receiving help on the **use of system features** (operating system, compilers, etc.)

‚úÖ Students discussing the **intention** (not solution method) of a problem

‚úÖ Students discussing **course material** for understanding (becomes suspect when notes are taken that can be directly incorporated into assignments)

### **Academic Dishonesty**

‚ùå A student submitting **work that is not original**

‚ùå A student submitting **someone else's work**, or a modification of that work, with or without that person's knowledge

‚ùå Students solving a problem as a **group when group work is prohibited** and submitting multiple copies, each as individual work

‚ùå A student using someone else's work, including segments of permitted program libraries, **without proper attribution**

### **Severe Academic Dishonesty**

üö´ A student using another student's work **without the latter's consent** or collaboration

üö´ A student **contracting course work out** to others

üö´ A student planning or executing **cooperative subterfuge during an exam**

## **Course-Specific Guidelines**

For this Statistical Computing course:

- **Programming assignments** must be completed individually unless explicitly stated otherwise
- You may discuss general concepts and approaches with classmates
- You may seek help from the instructor, TAs, or official documentation
- **All code must be your own** - copying code from classmates, online sources, or AI tools is prohibited
- Proper citation is required when using external libraries or code snippets from official documentation
- During exams, only authorized materials are permitted

## **Questions?**

If you are ever uncertain about whether an activity violates academic honesty policies, **ask the instructor before proceeding**. It is always better to clarify than to risk a violation.

Remember: Academic integrity is fundamental to your education and professional development as a data scientist and programmer.
