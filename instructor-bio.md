# **Instructor's Bio**

Dr. Wang is a financial modeler specializing in fixed income securities valuation, risk analytics, and portfolio management. With extensive experience in statistics, data mining, and machine learning, he develops advanced models to enhance business decision-making.

His research focuses on data mining, statistical modeling, and simulation, with applications in financial engineering and engineering management. He has led quantitative research projects at BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and Roosevelt, where he designed and implemented cutting-edge analytical solutions.

An Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University, Dr. Wang has also taught at the Data Science Institute and the Applied Analytics Program. He holds a Ph.D. in Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems, a M.S. in Operations Research and Statistics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a B.S. in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University, China.

Professor Goodrich is currently a full-time lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences Program at Columbia University. He is a political scientist by training, with research interests primarily in statistical computing. Since 2010, he has held a variety of academic positions, including postdoctoral researcher, full-time lecturer, part-time lecturer, and associate research scholar at Columbia University. Ben is also a core developer of the Stan software for Bayesian inference and the maintainer of the rstan and rstanarm R packages, which provide interfaces to Stan.

# **Instructor's Teaching Philosophy**

### **1. Learn by Imitation: Follow Live Coding Demos**
**Absorb techniques through observation.**

* **Why it works:** Mirrors how humans naturally learn complex skills (e.g., language or music).
* **How to apply:**
  * Shadow experts via platforms like Kaggle, YouTube, or pair programming.
  * Pause demos to predict the next step, then compare.
* **Example:** Recreate a GitHub project's data pipeline while noting design choices.

### **2. Learn by Repeat: Reinforce Through Practice**
**Build muscle memory for coding.**

* **Why it works:** Strengthens neural pathways (spaced repetition).
* **How to apply:**
  * Reimplement projects without referencing past code.
  * Participate in daily coding challenges (LeetCode, Advent of Code).
* **Example:** Rebuild a web scraper weekly, adding new features each time.

### **3. Learn by Contrast: Compare Methods**
**Develop critical thinking by evaluating trade-offs.**

* **Why it works:** Forces analysis of why one approach outperforms another.
* **How to apply:**
  * Benchmark alternatives (e.g., for loops vs. numpy vectorization).
  * Debate pros/cons (readability vs. scalability).
* **Example:** Solve a sorting problem with both quicksort and mergesort, then analyze edge cases.

### **4. Learn by Articulation: Debug and Explain**
**Solidify understanding through teaching.**

* **Why it works:** Uncovers gaps in knowledge (Feynman Technique).
* **How to apply:**
  * Write detailed code comments or blog posts.
  * Record yourself explaining a complex function.
* **Example:** Document how a machine learning model's hyperparameters affect outcomes.

### **5. Learn by Knowing the Application (Case Studies)**
**Connect theory to real-world impact.**

* **Why it works:** Context motivates retention and creativity.
* **How to apply:**
  * Study industry examples (e.g., how Netflix uses A/B testing).
  * Reverse-engineer solutions from papers or tech talks.
* **Example:** Analyze how a financial model predicted market crashes, then replicate its core logic.

## **Framework Synergy**

Combine these methods for exponential growth:

1. **Imitate** a case study's solution → **Contrast** it with alternatives.
2. **Articulate** the reasoning → **Repeat** the process in new contexts.

### **Optional Adaptations:**
* **For beginners:** Focus on imitation + repetition.
* **For advanced learners:** Emphasize contrast + articulation + case studies.
